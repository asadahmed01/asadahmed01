## Who am I? 

Hello World 👋, I am Asad
 
I'm a Full Stack developer from Canada. I love coding and working on impactful projects. I like playing and watching soccer ⚽. I am a big fan of Manchester United. When I am free I like to hike and watch movies. My favorite movie is Prison Break 👮🏽‍♀️⛓️.

## What am I doing now?
I am currently working as Full Stack Developer at [Harled Inc.](https://harled.ca/).
When it comes to technology, my newest favorite stack is Ruby on Rails which we use daily at Harled to modernize and digitize the Royal Canadian Air Force. I also like React and NodeJS, and who doesn't love Python 🐍, right?

## Currently
- 👀 I’m interested in emerging technologies such as AI and ML and solving problems with coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Ruby on Rails and its ecosystem.
- I'm currently reading about system designs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of personal projects.

## My approach to problem solving 💻 
Finding a suitable solution for issues can be fun, rewarding and sometimes daunting. 
I like to research and learn more about the problem before diving in.
However, not all issues are created equal and some may call for a slightly different approach.

## My most productive times ⏰ 
Many things can improve or sink productivity, however, when it comes to the time of the day, I am most productive between mid-morning and noon, as well as late afternoon and early evening.
